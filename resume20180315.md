Applicable Skills
====
Application
-----
* Javascript (in its latest Babel "stage 0" specifications for transpilation)
* Node.js (goes without saying)
* Comfortable with targeting JS for multiple environments; using tools like RollUp and WebPack
* Python (in its most recent CPython versions)
  * Intimate knowledge of WSGI, and applications and frameworks like Flask
* API Design (as in programming interfaces; architecture)
* Client-side application design, currently in love with Elm descendents like React+Redux, as well as ML descendents like Purescript.
* SQL Design
* Intimate knowledge of latest browser builds and Web Extenstion API.
* Similarly, experience with Electron (Chromium with a special fork of Node to make a completely platform-agnostic application framework; see Github Atom, Visual Studio Code, Slack, and many others.)

Systems
----
* Intimate familiarity with modern Linux. Everyday OS: Ubuntu or Debian.
* Good enough skills in bash, legacy init systems, Systemd.
* More than passing familiarity with languages like awk.
* Containerization: Docker and Vagrant
* Strongest skills in Linuxes, but can thrive in an Apple environment.

Networking
----
* HTTP and HTTP (ReST) Interface Design
* Understanding of HTTP (I've read Fielding and the latest HTTP specification)
* Understanding of OSI Model and ability to diagnose and solve most layer 3 and above problems.
* Familiarity with third-party cloud providers like AWS and Rackspace, as well as regular usage of smaller players like Linode (as old-fashioned as it is.)

Development
----
* Generally of the "editor + lots of terminal emulators" school (currently Atom or VSCode).
* Well-versed in different Git workflows, including Github, other Git front-ends, and email patches. Comfortable manipulating history (squashing, repairs, etc.)

Additional Experience and History
----
Same story as most in our field: Computing as a very young child (starting with a TRS-80 which required some basic knowledge with Basic to get started), PC clones and DOS/Windows during the 80s and picking up C. Music and art with Commodore machines like the Amiga 500. Hardhacks to make music with PCs in the early 90s, writing simple games.

Education
====
Besides work and personal experience, I dropped out of a community college while in a CS/Math program. I was a member of the last class to use C as a teaching language, as opposed to Java (for which I am eternally grateful). I was very fortunate to have a CS instructor from Bell Labs, from whom I learned a great deal informally during off-hours.

Total Work Experience
====
Considering consulting/contracting, personal work, and salaried FT employment, 15 years.
* Javascript and all other DOM technologies since the beginning (~1994)
* C, with enough competence and CS theory to justify my confidence, since ~1996
* Python since 2007
* PLT since ~2005
* Unix tools and similar (awk, perl, bash, etc.) since ~2001 (close to my first use of Linux)

Background
====

Open Source Projects
====
Too many projects to list, but as a sample:
* A Python port of a Nexrad (Weather Radar) decoder
* A Javascript Entity-Component-System Game Engine (minimal, but working)
* OpenSCAD-built models for printing (turns out that Github can render STL files, making Thingiverse unnecessary).
* Various documentation contributions; mostly just grammar, linking, etc.

Esoteric But Current Applicable Skills
====
* Advanced Javascript and related DOM technologies: WebGL, SVG, etc.
* Functional Programming in Javascript and Javascript transpilation targets
  * React/Redux
  * Purescript
  * The "Fantasy Land" Project
* Function Programming in general
  * Haskell (ML Family in general)
  * Schemes (Racket in particular)
* Curiosity about and skills in esoteric architecture patterns like Entity Component System.

Current Languages of Interest
====
* Purescript
* Rust
* Javascript
* Haskell
* Python

Hobbies and Activities
====
* Programming Language Theory and History
* Amateur essayist: human rights, history, philosophy
* Category and Type Theory (I'm a dabbler, but it's extremely enjoyable to me).
* Electronic Engineering
    * Microcontrollers and circuit layout (in particular, Kicad). Garage-level fab.
    * 3D-Printing; early supporter of RepRap. Philosophical supporter of "Afghan Lathe" sort of projects and OSHW to encourage means of production moving to smaller and smaller social units; e.g., farmers using out-of-IP-protection designs for farm equipment, use of free (libre) IP Cores in FPGAs.
    * Early supporter of the IPython Notebook (now Jupyter) project as well, to encourage use of and sharing and reproduction of results with code in academic papers.
    * Loudspeaker design.
    * Astrophotography (and astronomy along with it)
    
Philosophy and Advocacy
====
* Open source (especially but not exclusively libre software, FLOSS).
* Human rights, spreading the means of production as widely as possible; including programming literacy and hardware fabrication skill.

Work Experience
====
*As a full-time employee*

Ihiji (Now Control4)
----
All information will concern Ihiji, as my time with Control4 began in January and will (hopfully) end in March; additionally, their organization doesn't present opportunities for design for developers of my new station.

**Responsibilities**

*ServiceManager*

At the time of my hiring, my job description was to educate and design network architecture (HTTP) and Python application design, as well as present a way forward for our again Linux infrastructure (at the time, all of our systems were rapidly approaching EOL for CentOS/RHEL 5).

In addition, I was to inform and guide the design of Ihiji's latest product at the time, a web-based system resembling a CRM. This project, similarly, required me to rapidly impart my HTTP (ReST) knowledge to a team, and demonstrate what was, at the time, a current toolchain (Werkzeug/Flask).

The application was successfully completed, and runs to this day. Additionally, it taught us many lessons about building a robust Flask application, including test and build systems. This system ("ServiceManager") became a Beta or proof-of-concept for later iterations of our Flask servers, which my colleague Matthew Planchard expertly refined in future products.

*Invision Mobile*

I was approached by our CEO for my feelings about quickly building a "hybrid" (fake) mobile application for our Invision controller software; essentially, one WebView and our exisiting PHP software. I committed to at least looking at the problem and requirements.

Fortunately, through independent study, I had discovered and become proficient in Redux. Shortly thereafter, I discovered that Facebook had open-sourced React-Mobile. In a few short days, I had a real (not just a WebView) working mobile native application on iOS and Android, with a usable subset of features working.

Within a short period of days and weeks, Matthew had created a robust Flask backend, and assisted in taking us across the finish line in the Javascript, which he picked up quickly. This app, too, still works and remains available on app stores (though I don't know what business requirements has in store for its future).

*Mentorship*

Throughout my tenure, I taught and inspired (to the best of my ability) young developers, interns, and even developers with 30+ year careers who came through our offices at Ihiji. I'm proud of how they have done, though I am by no means a real, trained educator.

This may be the skill with which I contributed the most to Ihiji; it is certainly satisfying. I like to pass on as much as I can; though, I realize at Enthought that my Web and Application Programming abilities are a speciality and I probably have very little to show your many colleagures and contractors with advanced degrees! But for technology problems, I would hope that I would have a lot to offer your organization.
