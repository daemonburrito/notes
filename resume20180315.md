Applicable Skills
====
Application
-----
* Javascript (in its latest "stage 0" specifications for transpilation)
* Node.js (goes without saying)
* Comfortable with targeting JS for multiple environments; using tools like RollUp and WebPack
* Python (in its most recent CPython versions)
  * Intimate knowledge of WSGI, and applications and frameworks like Flask
* API Design (as in programming interfaces; architecture)
* Client-side application design, currently in love with Elm descendents like React+Redux, as well as ML descendents like Purescript.
* SQL Design
* Intimate knowledge of latest browser builds and Web Extenstion API.
* Similarly, experience with Electron (Chromium with a special fork of Node to make a completely platform-agnostic application framework; see Github Atom, Visual Studio Code, Slack, and many others.)

Systems
----
* Intimate familiarity with modern Linux. Everyday OS: Ubuntu or Debian.
* Good enough skills in bash, legacy init systems, Systemd.
* More than passing familiarity with languages like awk.
* Containerization: Docker and Vagrant
* Strongest skills in Linuxes, but can thrive in an Apple environment.

Networking
----
* HTTP and HTTP (ReST) Interface Design
* Understanding of HTTP (I've read Fielding and the latest HTTP specification)
* Understanding of OSI Model and ability to diagnose and solve most layer 3 and above problems.
* Familiarity with third-party cloud providers like AWS and Rackspace, as well as regular usage of smaller players like Linode (as old-fashioned as it is.)

Development
----
* Generally of the "editor + lots of terminal emulators" school (currently Atom or VSCode).
* Well-versed in different Git workflows, including Github, other Git front-ends, and email patches. Comfortable manipulating history (squashing, repairs, etc.)

Open Source Projects
====
Too many projects to list, but as a sample:
* A Python port of a Nexrad (Weather Radar) decoder
* A Javascript Entity-Component-System Game Engine (minimal, but working)
* OpenSCAD-built models for printing (turns out that Github can render STL files, making Thingiverse unnecessary).
* Various documentation contributions; mostly just grammar, linking, etc.

Esoteric But Current Applicable Skills
====
* Advanced Javascript and related DOM technologies: WebGL, SVG, etc.
* Functional Programming in Javascript and Javascript transpilation targets
  * React/Redux
  * Purescript
  * The "Fantasy Land" Project
* Function Programming in general
  * Haskell (ML Family in general)
  * Schemes (Racket in particular)
* Curiosity about and skills in esoteric architecture patterns like Entity Component System.

Current Languages of Interest
====
* Purescript
* Rust
* Javascript
* Haskell
* Python

Hobbies and Activities
====
* Programming Language Theory and History
* Amateur essayist: human rights, history, philosophy
* Category and Type Theory (I'm a dabbler, but it's extremely enjoyable to me).
* Electronic Engineering
    * Microcontrollers and circuit layout (in particular, Kicad). Garage-level fab.
    * 3D-Printing; early supporter of RepRap. Philosophical supporter of "Afghan Lathe" sort of projects and OSHW to encourage means of production moving to smaller and smaller social units; e.g., farmers using out-of-IP-protection designs for farm equipment, use of free (libre) IP Cores in FPGAs.
    * Early supporter of the IPython Notebook (now Jupyter) project as well, to encourage use of and sharing and reproduction of results with code in academic papers.
    * Loudspeaker design.
    * Astrophotography (and astronomy along with it)
    
Philosophy and Advocacy
====
* Open source (especially but not exclusively libre software, FLOSS).
* Human rights, spreading the means of production as widely as possible; including programming literacy and hardware fabrication skill.
