Applicable Skills
====
Application
-----
* Javascript (ES2015, ES7, experimental)
* Node.js
* Comfortable with targeting JS for multiple environments, using tools like RollUp and WebPack
* Python (CPython 2 and 3)
  * Intimate knowledge of WSGI, and applications and frameworks like Flask and Django

* Intimate knowledge of latest browsers and Web Extenstion API.
* Electron and React Native

Systems
----
* Intimate familiarity with modern Linux. Everyday OS: Arch, Ubuntu or Debian.
* Bash, legacy init systems, Systemd.
* Miscellaneous scripting languages such as awk.
* Containers/Virtualization: Kubernetes, Docker and Vagrant
* Strongest skills in Linuxes, but can live in an Apple environment.

Networking
----
* HTTP and HTTP (ReST) Interface Design
* Understanding of OSI Model and ability to diagnose and solve most layer 3 and above problems.
* Cloud providers: AWS and Google Cloud, as well as VPS's; Linode, etc.

Development Environment
----
* Generally of the "editor + lots of terminal emulators" school (currently Atom or VSCode).
* Well-versed in different Git workflows, including Github, other Git front-ends, and email patches. Comfortable manipulating history (squashing, repairs, etc.)

Open Source Projects
====
Too many projects to list, but as a sample:
* A Python Nexrad (Weather Radar) decoder
* A Javascript Entity-Component-System Game Engine (minimal, but working)
* OpenSCAD-built models for printing (turns out that Github and Gitlab can render STL files, making Thingiverse unnecessary).
* Various documentation contributions; mostly just grammar, linking, etc.

Work history
====

Additional Experience and History
----
Same story as most in our field: Computing as a very young child (starting with a TRS-80 which required some basic knowledge with Basic to get started), PC clones and DOS/Windows during the 80s and picking up C. Music and art with Commodore machines like the Amiga 500. Hardhacks to make music with PCs in the early 90s, writing simple games.

Education
====
Besides work and personal experience, I dropped out of a community college while in a CS/Math program. I was a member of the last class to use C as a teaching language, as opposed to Java (for which I am eternally grateful). I was very fortunate to have a CS instructor from Bell Labs, from whom I learned a great deal informally during off-hours.

Total Work Experience
====
Considering consulting/contracting, personal work, and salaried FT employment, 15 years.
* Javascript and all other DOM technologies since the beginning (~1994)
* C, with enough competence and CS theory to justify my confidence, since ~1996
* Python since 2007
* PLT since ~2005
* Unix tools and similar (awk, perl, bash, etc.) since ~2001 (close to my first use of Linux)

    * 3D-Printing; early supporter of RepRap. Philosophical supporter of "Afghan Lathe" sort of projects and OSHW to encourage means of production moving to smaller and smaller social units; e.g., farmers using out-of-IP-protection designs for farm equipment, use of free (libre) IP Cores in FPGAs.
    * Early supporter of the IPython Notebook (now Jupyter) project as well, to encourage use of and sharing and reproduction of results with code in academic papers.
    * Loudspeaker design.
    * Astrophotography (and astronomy along with it)

Philosophy and Advocacy
